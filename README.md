# Pokemon Collector

Pokemon Collector is a program developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, designed to fetch and display Pokémon data from the PokeAPI website.

## Functionality

1. The program prompts the user to decide whether they want to draw a Pokémon.
2. If the user answers yes, a random Pokémon name is fetched from the PokeAPI.
3. If the fetched Pokémon already exists in the local JSON database, existing data is retrieved from the database and presented to the user.
4. If it doesn't exist in the database, its details are fetched from the PokeAPI, stored for future reference, and then presented to the user.
